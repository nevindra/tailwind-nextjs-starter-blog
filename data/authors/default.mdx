As the Lead Product and solution Manager at Nodeflux, I lead multiple engineering teams in developing and delivering cutting-edge products that leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data. I am also a Master's candidate in Business Information System Management at the University of Gunadarma.

I have a proven track record of driving revenue growth, product adoption, and market share through effective go-to-market strategies, product costing and pricing, and competitive positioning. Some of my achievements include:

• Led the integration of Large Language Models (LLM) into Nodeflux's core technology, enhancing natural language processing capabilities and enabling sophisticated threat analysis.

• Spearheading the use of Knowledge Graphs in Nodeflux's core technology stack for a project, improving data relationships and enabling advanced contextual awareness in surveillance systems.

• Developed and executed a go-to-market strategy for a new product that generated over $650K in revenue within the first 12 months.

• Orchestrating strategic meetings that led to 3 significant partnership agreements and bolstered the pre-sales process.

I am passionate about innovation and collaboration and foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement among my teams. I always seek new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills and expertise to create impactful solutions. I am confident that I can bring value and leadership to any organization seeking to leverage AI, ML, and data.
